# Smart-Home
A Project for Sophomore practice of New Energy Science and Engineering of Southwest Jiaotong University
## Introduction
This is a project which used a simple wooden model and multiple sensors to reperesent a smart home. Mainly consisted by three parts, the model can realize a bunch of functions including temperature and humidity detection and regulation, fire alarm, intelligent access control for not only people but cars, smart window switch based on light and rain and so on.
Use Arduino Uno (ATmega328P) and Arduino Mega 2560 (ATmega2560), respectively corresponding to Folder Uno and Mega2560.
## Realization
Very basic and simple codes using cpp, hence with nothing to say >_<
